CIL 1.3.6 does not appear to build under the most 
recent version of OCaml (3.11.2) on x86 Linux (or Mac OS X).  Thus, neither does the 
modified version of CIL 1.3.6 distributed with CREST.

CIL 1.3.7 appears to build correctly.  I will upgrade the version of
 CIL distributed with CREST to 1.3.7.

(In the meantime, you may be able to use an older version of OCaml as a 
workaround.  OCaml 3.10.2 works on my system.)

how to install an older version 3.09 ocaml in cygwin? 
try OPAM
 -- install OPAM from source first
 -- get dependency: patch, gawk, m4, curl or wget, ocaml (need bootstrap!), ncurses, etc.
 -- version 1.1.1 seems broke on curl; have to uninstall/remove curl for force opam to use wget
 -- opam switch list shows ealiest 3.11.2; cannot auto switch to ocaml 3.09
    --- may try since the url for downloading is in a uniform: http://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-3.09
    --- Error: Cannot guess host type
        ---- possibly downlaoding binaries?
        ---- set "-host" "x86_64-unknown-cygwin" in ~/.opam/compilers/3.09/3.09.comp file
           ----- Error: have the same 'setmode' issue

may have trouble install ocaml 4.01.0 from source on 64bit cygwin, due to unfound symbol 'setmode' during compilation!
  --- http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin-patches/2013-q1/msg00043.html
  --- may have to patch ocaml sources/headers, or gnulib somewhere
  --- may use cygwin 32 bit instead. 
     ---- can have both 32 and 64 bit Cygwin installed.

Or use WODI, should work under cygwin-64, but not sure whether support older versions of ocaml
